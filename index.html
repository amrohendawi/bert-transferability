			<h1>Unraveling Transferability of BERT</h1>
			<h2>Abstract</h2>
			<p>
				In this article, we investigate the factors affecting the transferability of a BERT model trained on
				general natural language understanding to downstream, more specific tasks. These factors include number
				of layers, number of fine-tuning epochs, dataset size, and label noise.
				We find that, in general, a shallower BERT model transfers better than a deeper model, and that a model
				trained with more data and for more epochs transfers better than a model trained with less data and for
				fewer epochs. We also find that label noise has a negative effect on transferability.

			<h2>Introduction</h2>
		</section>
		<p>
			Since their introduction in 2017, Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) have taken NLP by storm, offering
			enhanced parallelization and better modeling of long-range dependencies. The best known Transformer-based
			model is BERT (Devlin et al., 2019); it obtained state-of-the-art results in numerous benchmarks and is
			still a must-have baseline.

		</p>
		<p>
			BERT is a deep learning model that has been shown to be effective for a range of natural language
			understanding tasks. However, it is not clear how well BERT transfers to more specific tasks. In this
			article, we investigate the factors that affect the transferability of BERT. These factors include the
			number of layers, the number of fine-tuning epochs, the dataset size, and the label noise.
		</p>
		We first consider the linguistic aspects of it, such as the number of layers, the number of fine-tuning epochs,
		and the dataset size. We find that, in general, a shallower BERT model transfers better than a deeper model, and
		that a model trained with more data and for more epochs transfers better than a model trained with less data and
		for fewer epochs.
		We also consider the effect of label noise on transferability. We find that label noise has a negative effect on
		transferability.
		</p>
		<p>
			In conclusion, we find that the transferability of BERT is affected by a number of factors, including the
			number of layers, the number of fine-tuning epochs, the dataset size, and the label noise.

				<h2>Factors</h2>
				<p>
					In this section we discuss the main factors that affect the transferability of BERT. These factors
					are the number of layers, the number of fine-tuning epochs, the dataset size, and the label noise.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div id="dev-edit-html">
				<h3>Fine-tuning</h3>
				<p>
					The per-slide HTML editor can be accessed from the slide options area. It gives you raw access to
					the current slide's HTML, allowing you to change anything you like. Note that some elements, such as
					&lt;script&gt; and &lt;link&gt;, are not allowed for security reasons.﻿
				</p>
			</div>

			<div id="dev-element-classes">
				<h3>Dataset</h3>
				<p>
					As a paying Slides customer you have access to the <a href="#css">CSS editor</a> which allows you to
					add custom styles to your deck. By turning on the developer mode a new "class name" field will
					appear for any block that you focus. This allows you to easily target a specific element with your
					CSS.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here's an example that defines an "upside-down" class using custom CSS and applies it to a text
					block.
				</p>
				<pre class="code-block" data-highlight-theme="github-gist"><code class="hljs css">.upside-down {
						transform: scale( 1, -1 );
					}</code></pre>
			</div>

			<div id="dev-slide-classes">
				<h3>Task Similarity<a href="/pricing" class="header-secondary-text">(Requires Pro)</a></h3>
				<p>
					Just like you can add custom classes to individual elements it's also possible to add custom classes
					at the slide level. This can used to apply broader changes to the whole slide like inverting text
					and icon colors or changing the slide transition.
				</p>

				<p>
					Under the hood the slide background element is separate from the slide itself. Here are two examples
					showing how you'd target the slide contents or slide background using a custom class called
					"night-sky":
				</p>

				<pre class="code-block" data-highlight-theme="github-gist"><code class="hljs css">// Targets the slide contents
.slides .night-sky svg path {
    fill: yellow;
}

// Target the slide background
.backgrounds .night-sky {
    background: linear-gradient(0deg, #141528, #0b1bb2);
}</code></pre>

			<div id="dev-export-html">
				<h3>Embeddings Quality</h3>
				<p>
					You can access the complete HTML for all slides in your deck ﻿inside of the export panel, under
					"Export to reveal.js"﻿. This provides a way of exporting your deck markup and the core Slides styles
					to reveal.js. There are a few limitations with exporting this way but it should provide a good
					starting point.

				<h2>CSS Editor <a href="/pricing" class="header-secondary-text">(Requires Pro)</a></h2>
				<p>
					The CSS editor lets you author custom styles for your presentation with a real-time preview of the
					result. It's available as an option inside of the Style panel of the presentation editor.
				</p>
				<p>
					The editor preprocesses styles using <a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a>, though you're free to
					write plain CSS as well. We apply the styles in real-time as you type so there's no need to leave
					the editor or even press a refresh button to see what you're getting. Note that when your styles are
					saved they will be automatically wrapped in a ".reveal {}" selector to avoid conflicts with other
					page styles.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="css-fonts">
				<h3>Custom Fonts</h3>
				<p>
					You can load custom fonts from Typekit and Google fonts and apply them using custom CSS. <a
						href="http://help.slides.com/knowledgebase/articles/1077976-custom-fonts-pro">Find out more</a>.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="css-developer-mode">
				<h3>Developer Mode</h3>
				<p>
					If you turn on the <a href="#dev">developer mode</a> you can also add custom classes to any focused
					element. This is a convenient way to easily apply your CSS to specific elements.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div id="css-examples">
				<h3>Examples</h3>
